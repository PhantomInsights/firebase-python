# Firebase Auth

Before using the `Auth` service you need to configure the providers you want to use.

Each provider requires a different setup process. Individual guides are provided explaining how to achieve this.

## Email with Password and Anonymous
*Main guide: [Email & Password Auth](./email)*

Firebase Auth can also work without using a Federated provider. Email and Anonymous auth have been separated into their own guide.
